# QTCord
QTCord is a Discord client aiming to bring a native look and feel chat experience. I am not responsible if you get your account banned from this project.

## Setup
Throw your token into `discordauth.txt` and copy any discord channel id (enable developer mode, right click, copy id) and throw that into `discord_channel.txt`.

Then do the standard Python procedure:
`python3 -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Afterwards, just run main.py.
```shell
python3 src/main.py
```

## Notes for developers
The code is a mess, since I'm still working on it. Have fun!
