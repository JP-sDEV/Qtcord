## Notes for developers
The code is a mess, since I'm just working on this for fun. Have fun! And if you're feeling very helpful, maybe even clean it up for me! ðŸ˜…

When you need to regenerate the ui files, create the file `~/Documents/regenerate_ui_files_indicator.txt`.
More notes are in `projects_notes.txt`.
