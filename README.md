## Setup

Do the standard Python procedure:
`python3 -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Cd into src
`cd src/`

Afterwards, just run main.py.
```shell
python3 main.py
```

## Notes for developers
The code is a mess, since I'm still working on it. Have fun!

When you need to regenerate the ui files, create the file `~/Documents/regenerate_uirea_files_indicator.txt`.
