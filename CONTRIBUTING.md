## Reverse Engineering
I highly recommend [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh28F6f-Cds) for getting started with reverse engineering the Discord API.

## Coding Guidelines
Try to follow PEP-8 (the squiggly underlines in Pycharm) standards. If you can't, that's perfectly fine.

To edit the user interface, use QT designer and put the UI files under `src/ui`. Create the file `~/Documents/regenerate_ui_files_indicator.txt` to have the UI match what's in the UI files.
