## Coding Guidelines
Try to follow PEP-8 (the squiggly underlines in Pycharm) standards. If you can't, that's perfectly fine.

To edit the user interface, use QT designer and put the UI files under `src/ui`. Create the file `~/Documents/regenerate_ui_files_indicator.txt` to have the UI match what's in the UI files.
